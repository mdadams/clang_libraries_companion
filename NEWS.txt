This document highlights some of the more significant changes from one
release of the lecture slides (and companion Git repository) to the next.

Edition 0.2.0 (2024-01-25)
==========================

Some of the more significant changes in going from Edition 0.1.0 to Edition
0.2.0 are as follows:

* The slides and code examples have been updated to be based on
  LLVM/Clang 17, instead of Clang 15 (as was the case with the previous
  edition of the slides).  The code examples still continue to work with
  LLVM/Clang 15 and 16, however.  The API differences between LLVM/Clang
  15, 16, and 17 are handled by conditional compilation in the case of the
  non-slide code examples and by using multiple separate source files in
  the case of code examples that appear on slides (so as to avoid clutter).

* Numerous smaller improvements to the slides were made, including adding
  more hyperlinks to external LLVM/Clang documentation.

* A Dockerfile was added to the Companion Git repository in order
  to provide an easy-to-use environment in which to build and run the
  code examples.  This is expected to be helpful to beginners who do not
  already have a working LLVM/Clang environment.

* Some bugs fixes and other improvements were made to the Clang Auxiliary
  Library (CAL), including fixing some problems in the function used to
  determine the Clang include directory.

* A new CMake find module was introduced for LLVM and Clang in an
  attempt to reduce boilerplate needed in many CMakeLists.txt files.

* Build-time introspection was added to determine whether the custom
  Fmt library is needed for std::format support.

* Many improvements were made to the scripts used (either directly or
  indirectly) for running the various code examples for demo purposes.

* Many changes were made to the scripts and configuration files used
  for the GitHub CI workflow.

* A formal JSON schema for compilation databases was added for reference
  purposes.

Edition 0.1.0 (2023-08-03)
==========================

Some of the more significant changes in going from Edition 0.0 to Edition
0.1.0 are as follows:

* Approximately 120 new slides were added along with a number of new code
  examples in the Git repository.

* Numerous improvements were made to the old content as well.

Edition 0.0 (2022-12-31)
========================

* This was the initial release of the lecture slides.

* This edition of the slides is based on LLVM/Clang 15.
